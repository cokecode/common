Readme for Spatial OCI sample code

This sample code illustrates the use of OCI in reading and writing instances 
of type MDSYS.SDO_GEOMETRY from and to a table containing a column of type
mdsys.sdo_geometry.

The following chapters of the OCI documentation are relevant to this example:
All of Part II: OCI Object Concepts 

Additionally the following OCI object functions are used in the code:
OCIDescribeAny(), OCIObjectNew(), OCIDefineObject(), OCIObjectPin(), 
OCIObjectFree().

See the file demo_sdo.mk for instructions on compiling the sample code.
It is assumed you have an Oracle 8i server or client installation on
the machine where these programs are being compiled. The ORACLE_HOME
environment variable must be set appropriately.

Usage:
Writegeom assumes the user has a table named test_insert which has columns
(gid NUMBER) and (geometry mdsys.sdo_geometry) at the very least. It is
invoked on the command line as 
writegeom username password

Readgeom takes the following command line arguments:
username 
password
table_name - Table with column of type mdsys.sdo_geometry
geom_column_name - Name of column of type mdsys.sdo_geometry (e.g. Geometry)
id_column_name - Name of column of type NUMBER that contains unique id values
                 for rows in that table <table_name>, e.g. GID
num_dimensions - Number of ordinates per point or vertex of a geometry,
                 e.g. 2 if each point has (X,Y) coordinates.

Sample command line invocation of readgeom:
readgeom dan dan test_insert geometry gid 2
